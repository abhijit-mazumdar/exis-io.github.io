A string in reverse domain name form that uniquely identifies a single agent. Domains may be nested by separating subdomains with periods. A subdomain is owned by its parent. 


## General

Domains are subtly different from names, although the name of an agent is also the name of its domain. A domain is a realm of influence and administration and provides implicit permissions management.
