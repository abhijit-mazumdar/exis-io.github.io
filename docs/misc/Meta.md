This wiki contains two kinds of content: development and overview. The overview content is there to provide a rough and high level description to the system. It is intended for external developers, users, and other curious parties. 

The development content indexed on the [[Components|Components]] describes exis as a system, including requirements, specifications, and implementation details. In these pages you'll find blockquoted sections that start with **Meta** and **V2**. The former is discussion or commentary, the latter describes features that are idealized and currently out of scope. 

Unless otherwise specified, assume that *Specification** subsections are complete and rigorous descriptions of the component.
