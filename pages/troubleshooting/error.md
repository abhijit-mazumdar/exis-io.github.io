# Error Notifications

When we are unable to notify you of problems with your device via the dashboard (e.g. the network is not available) we provide feedback through alternative means.

## Raspberry Pi

On the Raspberry Pi we notify you via the 'ACT' LED using a distinctive pattern of dots (short flashes) and dashes (longer flashes) similar to Morse code - this will continue to be displayed as long as the problem remains.

Given that '.' is a dot and '_' is a dash, possible messages are:-

* `. . _ _ _ . .` - Cannot connect to the network.
