# Help, I bricked my Edison!

If your Edison is unresponsive or for some bizarre reason, you want to restore your Edison to its unresinfied state, we've prepared a guide for you:

## Tools

Firstly visit the [Intel Edison Downloads page][edison-dl-page] and download the latest version of the 'Intel EdisonÂ® Board Firmware Software Release'. At the time of writing it is the [Release 2.1 Yocto* complete image][dl-link].

While you are on this page, download and install Intel's Flash Tool Lite. The setup guide for this tool can be found [here][flash-tool-setup].

## Re-Flashing the Edison

Once you have the Flash tool setup and your new Edison image is downloaded, unzip and start the Flash Tool Lite with the Edison *disconnected* from your computer.

Select the blue browse button in the top right of the flash tool and find the folder that contains the extracted Edison OS files, select `FlashEdison.json` as the 'Flash file' and click __Start to Flash__ to kick off the process:

A small warning wipp pop up indicating that no device is connected - fix this by connecting your Edison via micro usb cable:

![Start Flashing](/img/edison/flashtool-device-unconnected.png)

After a short delay your device will be detected and a progress bar will track the process of flashing your device, so sit back and relax:

After a few minutes the flashing process will be complete and the flash tool will look something like this:

![Flashing complete](/img/edison/flashtool-complete.png)

At this point your Edison will reboot. Once it's rebooted you might get a warning like this:

<img src="/img/edison/edison-restart-warning.png" alt="eject warning" style="width: 70%" />

If so, simply click __Ignore__ - it means that the file system applied to your Edison is not one your OS is familiar with.

## You're Done!

You should now have a Edison running the factory default Yocto build from Intel.
