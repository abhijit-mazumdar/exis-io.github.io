# A Fabric Tour

Networked code is some of the most complicated and error prone part of most applications. It takes up a lot of time, effort, and lines of code and most people don't do it perfectly-- its hard! You can be an expert with a language on a given platform and make incredible software, but when you decide to take that application to the internet a whole new suite of skills is required. 

1. Data interchange formats: XML, JSON
2. Protocols: HTTP or socket-based communication
3. Networking: IP and DNS addressing
4. Security: secure communication and data storage, authentication
5. API Design: REST, SOAP, and design security
6. Sever Design: concurrency, reliability, and scalability  

You could spend a whole career specializing in just one of these topics! As software developers in this day and age, where software design and tools are more and more powerful, where we're expected to be experts in multiple fields all the time, how can we write better network code? The better question is actually __why do we keep writing networking code__?
