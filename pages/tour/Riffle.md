# Riffle

Riffle is a protocol with libraries for all the popular languages that lets any code talk to any other code in the world in a way that looks like native method calls.

Riffle is a protocol that almost any language can use that enables that lets applications communicate with any other language using riffle in a way that looks like native code. We hate redundant, and one of the biggest problems with networking code is redundancy. Here are some of the important things we automate within riffle.

## Message Patterns

PubSub
RPC

## Type Guarantees

Cumin-
Number of args
Arg types
Serialization and deserialization

## Sessions

Connection abstraction
