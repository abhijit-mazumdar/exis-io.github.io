# Getting Started

Learn how to set up a project to communicate over the fabric. You can also download preconfigured projects. 

## iOS

Set up an Xcode project as an iOS app frontend and Swift container running as a backend. To create the project without the backend, skip the steps marked *Container*.

Download preconfigured projects with these links. If you publish the app you will have to change the name.

__Warning:__ Xcode versions below 7.0 are not supported. Additionally, Xcode 7.1 has some conflicts with cocoapods 0.38. If you run into errors with `importing modular import in non modular framework` delete the directory `Pods/Headers/Private`.
